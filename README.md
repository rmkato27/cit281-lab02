lab 2 used the vscode terminal to create a github repo, as well as adding files, ignoring files, and viewing how it interacts with github in the browser. 

I learned more about github, and the capabilites of the terminal in vscode, and how it makes it easier to code and create github repos. I learned how to sucessfully interact with both.
